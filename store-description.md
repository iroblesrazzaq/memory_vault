Memory Vault runs quietly in the background, analyzing pages you visit with substantial content (50+ words). It extracts the meaningful text, creates AI-powered embeddings that understand context and meaning, then stores everything locally for lightning-fast search.

When you search, your query is also converted to AI embeddings and matched against your history using semantic similarity - finding relevant pages even if they use completely different words!
